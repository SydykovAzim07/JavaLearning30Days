# Java Learning: 30 Days to Junior Developer

This repository documents my 30-day journey to learn Java from scratch to a Junior Developer level. The code is organized by topics and days, covering Java fundamentals, OOP, collections, exceptions, file I/O, JDBC, multithreading, Spring, and more.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code, divided by topics (e.g., `basics`, `oop_basics`, `final_project`).
- `docs/`: Notes and additional materials.
- Each topic contains subfolders for specific days (e.g., `day01`, `day02`).

## Progress
- **Day 1**: Basics (variables, Scanner, simple calculations).
- More to come as I progress through the 30-day plan!

## Goals
- Master Java fundamentals.
- Build a final project (e.g., a task management app).
- Prepare for Junior Developer interviews.
